# Template for Gated Infrastructure Deploy

TL;DR: AzDO Pipeline Template wrapping terraform apply and plan with a manual verification step, aka gate, to give a chance to check resources to be destroyed are expected.

> [!WARNING]
> The terraform plan cannot foresee every possible circumstance and scenario when determining changes to the infrastructure, only the terraform apply will truly know what changes will be made. Always test in an development environment first before moving to production.
